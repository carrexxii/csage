# CSage

Game engine for a one day/maybe/could be game<sup>TM</sup> - mainly just for experimenting.

Written purely in C (C11 with some GCC/Clang extensions) with SDL and Vulkan. Most other dependencies can be seen in `.gitmodules`

Currently the direction is for 2.5D graphics with 3D models. Tiled is used for map drawing and models are loaded via GLTF files.
